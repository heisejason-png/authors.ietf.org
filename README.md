This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ietf/authors.ietf.org) is the content of the site https://authors.ietf.org  Changes can be proposed here via pull requests. Please note the following guidance for submitters:

* Synchronisation and change control:
    * Synchronisation between this repository and the site is bi-directional and triggered every 5 minutes.
    * Until the site goes live, regular edits will be made in the wiki system that will then be pushed to this repository.
* Content conventions:
    * Internet-Drafts are referred to as 'Internet-Drafts' or 'I-Ds', never 'drafts'
    * Internal page links use the full title of the page, not any other text.
    * Headings always start at H1 and then to H2 then H3 and so on.
    * The content is largely in the second person - written as if talking to the authors of I-Ds.
    * Pages are kept on topic, duplication is minimised and appropriate links added
* Markdown dialect:
   *  The pages all have a header table automatically generated by wiki.js.  This should be ignored when editing.
   *  Wiki.js uses the {.tabset} construct which is not recognised by GitHub Flavoured Markdown and so will not render correctly in GitHub previews.
